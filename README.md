## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am the Leeds Institute of Health Sciences and Bradford Institute for Health Research repository.

I provide medical code lists such as MedCodeId, Read codes, Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine â€“ Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT), International Classification of Diseases - 10 (ICD-10), and British National Formulary (BNF), for different projects.

I am currently working on the projects:
